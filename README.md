# List of cute cat behaviors
- Purring when they are happy or content.
- Kneading with their paws, also known as "making biscuits."
- Giving gentle head butts to show affection.
- Stretching their bodies in a long, graceful arch after waking up.
- Rolling over and exposing their belly when they feel safe and comfortable.
- They remember words such as "play", "rice" and "snack".
- Raging!!
- Sleeping and relaxing in a kotatsu(kotatsu: japanese heating appliances)
- When a kitten is yawning
- When she is purring
- Cats love warm places. So they might rub against their owners to feel their body heat. It is cute.
