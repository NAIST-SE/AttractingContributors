# Attracting Contributors
As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

# Requirements

1. Fork this project and then rename the title to your hobby. 
2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.
3. Make 10 Pull Request contributions to other projects

My Project (Anime-collection)<br/>
Goal - I want contributors to help me list some favorite Japanese Role-Playing Game(JRPG).<br/>
If you also like JRPG, please do not hesitate to share them with me and let me know more excellent games of this kind. <br/>

Thank you very much!

Either English or Japanese is fine, and the more niche, the better.
